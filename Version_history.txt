#       Test with real data
#       implemetd mqtt
#       implemented scrambled vs nonscrambled (needs to be tested in with old inverter)
#       Growatt old wifi release support (needs to be tested with old inverter)
#       Read config file and commandline parms
#       Verbose vs non verbose
#       Enable running as a services and automatic startup after reboot
#       Code review by peer
#       Added in github: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott
#       Document and add service example to git
#
#Done   in 1.0.5
#V      Changed some verbose print output to trace ouput to keep verbose messages clean and lean
#V      Add more relevant values to JSON message
#V      Make print data unbufferd to see messages direct in journal when running as as service (python -u parm added in grott.service )
#V      MQTT error handling improved
#V      Process and sent values only if PVstatus is 0 or 1. Detected unexpected values while pvstatus was 257. This an quick fix. Has to look for realroot cause reason (probably not a monitor record)
#V      included messages for problem detection / solving of unexpected PVSTATUS = 257 issue
#
#Done   in 1.0.6
#       Resolved problem with specifing offset in .ini. Change in record by growatt (Since 23 March 2020) now need a offset of 26!
#       Specify valueoffset = 26 and compat = True in ini file!
#Done   in 1.0.7
#       Resolved problem with unecrypted records
#       added authentication (user / password) for MQTT, specify in MQTT section of ini auth = False (default ) or True and user = "xxxxxxx" (grott : default) password = "xxxxx" (default : growatt2020)
#Done   in 1.0.8
#       Really solved problem with unecrypted records
#Done   in 1.0.9

#Done   in 1.1.1
#       Only test version no real changes
#Done   in 1.1.2
#       Change MQTT publish.single keepalive =60 (default), this seem to solve disconnect error (client was always connected, is not the intention with publish.single)

#2.0.4	Not published
#	    Preperation for Docker support
#2.1.0
#   Automatic Protocol detection (first step)
#	Initial Support for shinelink lan box
#	Improve unscramble routine (preperation for server mode)
#2.1.1
#	Enhanced docker support (more startup parms, env variable support)
#   Improve / repair automatic protocol detection
#   enable dynamic protocol layout (override existing layout, override pre-defined values)
#   almost all .ini keywords available as env. variables start (see wiki for more details
2.1.2
#	Direct pvoutput.org support
#       in ini file
#           in [mqtt]       mqtt = yes (default) or no (no mqtt processing)
#           in [pvoutput]   pvoutput = no (default) or yes (send to pvoutput)
#                           apikey =
#                           systemid =

#                           gpvoutput(yes/no)
#                           gpvapikey
#                           gpvsystemid
#       new grott command parm: -p (enables transmit pvoutput )
2.1.3 (Not published, internal test only)
#	Changed automatic protocol conversion for wifi-x, growatt TL-X inverters
#   If available get date/time from invertor data record (prohibit wrong time if buffered data is sent after reconnect).
#        If not available server datetime will be used
#   First step to filter command comming from Growatt (to prevent unwanted remote changes or control of inverter and hacking).
#       Be aware data will still be sent to growatt!!
2.2.0
#   (Only published as docker container for tests)
#	Enhanced automatic protocol conversion (also allow sending saved records)
#   Create command filter from Growatt server (to prevent unwanted remote changes or control of inverter and hacking): blockcmd = True in .ini or -b/--blockcmd at startup
#   Allow change IP address from Growatt server  if wanted for testing/changing (use only temporary!) noipf = True in .ini or -n/--noipf at startup
#   Created and published docker images (see dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/u/ledidobe)
#   Added json key "buffered" to MQTT message. If "buffered": "no", the record is actual,
#     if  "buffered":"yes" the record is send from the buffer in the inverter (saved) and created in the past (advise: use date/time in record, not actual date/time).
2.2.1
# Some minor (cosmetic) improvements on 2.2.0
# Show inverter id = automatic if not specified in .ini
# Show Grott ip address as default if not specified
# Show IP and Port messages during proxy startup
2.2.1c
# Minor cosmetic and stability changes
2.2.1d
# repair issue with automatic protocol detection
2.2.2
#Added support for MIN 36000-TL XE / With ShineLan
2.2.3
added additional test for date-time validation in data record the solve time issues with TL3-s inverter (issue 22)
added time = auto/server parameter in .ini and gtime = auto server environment variable to disable time retrieval form data record (server), default is auto: grott decides which time is used (data record if vald otherwise Server)
sample grott.ini sample .ini file to examples directory (issue 21) to make it easier to retrieve grott from github (no .ini overwrites anymore)
2.2.4
Data from buffer will set with the data from the record (it does not make sense to send historical data with actual server time). If the data/time does not have the right format the data will not be sent to MQTT and PVOutput
New parameter sendbuf = True / False (default True) to enable / disable sending historical data. Environmental variable: gsendbuf = True/False
fixed json time error when running in compat = True mode
added data layout for T020404 record
fixed decryp definition problem in external data layout jso files.
2.2.4a
processing for t055104 data record added
remove requirment for distutils (for compatibility reason)
2.2.5
Simplified data processing record allow generic definition (T0xNNNNX) so less layout definitions are needed.
Enable PVOUTPUT for multiple inverters (specify , pvinverters=1-8, pvsystemidx x=integer). default pvinverters = 1 and pvsystemid = <your systemid>
   For comptibility reason specifing pvsystemid = <yoursystemid> is the same as specifing pvsystemid1 = <yoursystemid>
2.2.6
Changed support for multiple inverters to supported all kind combination of inverters with 1 grott instance,
Enable PVOUTPUT for multiple inverters (specify , pvinverters=1-8, pvsystemidx=<pvoutput systemid>, pvinverteridx=<inverterid for pvsystemidx>  x=integer, pv).
      default pvinverters = 1 and pvsystemid = <your systemid>
2.3.0
Support direct output to Influxdb. See wiki for more information how to enable (resolve issue: #29)
allow true / false (lower cases) in ini file and environmental variables (resolve issue: #24 )
2.3.1
Added support for influxdb V2
2.3.1a
bugfix:  influx ip address localhost will be translated to 0.0.0.0
Grott processing will end with an error if influxdb initialisation fails
2.3.1b
influxdb organization check at initialization only for information. Grott will not be stopped if organization can not be found.
      a token with only read/write permission is not allowed to find organisations (tested with influxdb 2.0.4)
influxdb write error will stop grott processing (just to be save if organization is not available)
2.4.0
Introduce possibility to add extensions for additional (personalized) processing.
 see wiki for more information:
create extension directory with extension examples
2.4.1
Fixed date proble with T065150X record layout
2.5.0
Change data / layout processing.
Improved dynamic data processing  and dynamic generation of output depended on keywords specified in record layout makes it possible:
      - easy add new keyword / values to process
      - rename keywords
      - external layout definitions with a layout json file still exist and make it now possible for users to easily add / change the data processing
      - define print (verbose) layout of values
2.5.1
Cosmetic change (change devide in divide)
2.5.2
Bugfix for specifing IP port definitions in environmentals (gmqttport, qifport, ggrowattport)
Add additional checking for IP address definitions in environmentals.
2.5.3
Allow negative values for pvpowerout (added type = numx to recordlayout) because new Growatt inverter can also publish neagtive values
Complement bugfix prepared by KBraham (issue / pull request #41)
2.5.4
-Change PVIMPTEMP for the extend records (T05nnnnX and t06nnnnX)
-Added new values for to T05nnnnX records.
2.6.0 (Never published)
- Support for SPF (offgrid/Battery) and SPH (on-grid/Battery) inverters. New parameter, invtype= (env variable ginvtype=) to specify the inverttype and
  and select new record lauout (e.g. T060104XSPH). Be awere this can also be used to create own record layout (no check on record type, so invtype=test
  will search for T060104XTEST). Default invtype=default, this means normal processing without suffix.
  Standard processing is include in Grott for SPH/SPF
- Add PVOutput for SPH (add pvenerytoday == eactoday, same offset => double keyword!) !be awere not tested with real inverters yet!
- Add PVOutput for SPF (add pvenerytoday == epvtoday, pvpowerout=opwatt, pvgridvoltage = outputvolt, same offset => double keywords!) !be awere not tested with real inverters yet!
- Added keyword incl :  yes/no  to layout value definition. "incl" : "no"  means this value processing is suppresed and will not be shown in
  verbose output and not sent to MQTT and Influxdb. Added some keyword with incl = no (where commented out in prev versions)
  includeall=True (gincludall=True) will process also exluded values.
2.6.1
- Include support for Growatt Smart Meter (connected with inverter)
  Seperate MQTT, Influx records will be created (with datalogserial, smart meter id,  as device/mesurement)
  Power and tot energy being used from grid are sent to PVOutput.org in 2 additional calls.
2.6.1a
- Bugfix SPF record processing
2.6.1b
- Filter (ignore) invalid 0120 smart meter record
2.6.1c
- Bugfix when sendbuf = False now only buffered records are filtered.  In the pase if specified also non buffered records were filtered.
- Be aware: Buffered records with invalid time (time from server) are also filtered.
2.6.1d
-Added statement to [pvoutput] section: pvinverter = 2 [This specifies # inverters to be processed, See also issue #53]
-Change grott home directory from Growatt in Grott [see issue #71]
2.6.1e
- Merge pull request #57 from redthor/2.6-print-env
2.6.1f
- bugfix for spf3000 fields pvenergytoday, pvenergytotal (and add duplicate fields as called in growatt xls/csv reports epvToday, epvTotal)
2.6.1g
- add support for TL3-X inverters. Please specify invtype=tl3 in the [Generic] section of the .ini file (or env variable : -e ginvtype=tl3 for docker run)
2.7.0
- SDM630/Raillog connect support
- SDM630/Inverter connected 3 phases support
- (a) added support for seperate topic for smart meter
    - by default noting changes topic name will be energy/growatt (unless overidden in .ini: topic = <topic> in MQTT section or environmental variable gmqtttopic = "<topic>" )
    - if mtopic = True in .ini [MQTT section] (or gmqttmtopic = "True" environmental) the smart meter topic will be: energy/meter
    - smartmeter topic name can be overridden by:
      - mtopicname = <topicname> in .ini [MQTT]
      - gmqttmtopicname = "<topicname" environmental
- (b) fix MQTT message is not sent
2.7.1
- Add coding from Pull req #91 (csv export exentsion)
  Add a CSV export extension in the examples/extensions dir. Closes #76

  One CSV file per day is saved.

  extvar configuration:
  "outpath": path where to save CSV files, default: "/home/pi/grottlog"
  "csvheader": comma separated string with fields to store, defaults to all available fields
