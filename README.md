<i><b>Beta 2.7.x is available in seperate branch.
<br>Included in this branch: the first beta of grottserver which can act as destination for inverter/datalogger data. This will remove need to cummunicate with internet. See discussions (#98) for more information: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/discussions/98).
<br>The beta branche is available at: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/tree/2.7-(Beta)</b></i> 

Growatt inverters can send performance and status metrics (log data) to the Growatt company servers. The inverters rely on either a ShineWIFI module or a ShineLAN box to relay the data to Growatt. The metrics stored on the Growatt servers then can be viewed on the Growatt website or using the ShinePhone mobile app. 

The purpose of Grott is to read, parse and forward the *raw metrics as they are sent* to Growatt servers. This means other applications can consume the raw Growatt metrics without relying on the Growatt API and servers and without delay. 

### Please see: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki/@Statement-of-use-and-limitations before using Grott. 

### Two modes of metric data retrieval
Grott can intercept the inverter metrics in two distinct modes:
* Proxy mode (man in the middle): The Growatt ShineWifi or ShineLAN box can be easily configured to use Grott as an alternative server to the default server.growatt.com. Grott then acts as a relay to the Growatt servers. Grott reads the transmitted data, and then forwards the data to server.grott.com.
* Sniff mode (original connection): Can be used if your router is linux based. IPTables NAT masquerading is used in conjuction with a python packet sniffer to read the data. (This is more resource intensive on the linux host).


### Where Grott can forward metric data to
Grott can forward the parsed metrics to: 
* MQTT (suggested option for many home automation systems such as Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz)
* InfluxDB v1 and v2 (a time series database with dashboarding functionality) 
* PVOutput.org (a service for sharing and comparing PV output data)
* Custom output using the extension functionality (Examples available for Export to CSV files and writing to a Http Server).  


### Compatibility
The program is written in python and runs under Linux, Windows.
It can run:
* Interactive from the command line interface
* As a Linux or Windows service
* As a [Docker container](https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki/Docker-support).  

And is tested, but not limited to, inverter models:
+ 1500-S (ShineWiFi)
+ 3000-S  (Shinelan)
+ 2500-MTL-S (ShineWiFi)
+ 4200-MTL-S (Shinelan)
+ 5000TL-X   (ShineWifi-X)
+ 3600TL-XE (ShineLink-X)
+ 3600TL-XE (ShineLan)
+ MOD 5000TL3-X* (ShineLan)
+ MOD 9000TL3-X*

**Experimental in latest 2.6 branch*

The Docker images are tested RPI(arm32), Ubuntu and Synology NAS

## Grott installation

### ShineLAN or ShineWIFI configuration
If Grott is running in proxy mode the ShineLAN box or ShineWIFI module [needs to be configured](https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki/Rerouting-Growatt-Wifi-TCPIP-data-via-your-Grott-Server) to send data to Grott instead of the Growatt server API.
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki) for further information and installation details. 

## What's new

#### TL3-X 3 phase inverter support 
see issue #81/#82/#85: add invtype=tl3 in grott.ini [Generic] section (or use ginvtype="tl3" environmental variable e.g. for docker ledidome/grott:2.6.1f)
#### SPF off grid inverter support 
see issue #42/#46: add invtype=spf in grott.ini [Generic] section (or use ginvtype=spf environmental variable e.g. for docker)
#### SPH hybrid (grid/battery) support 
see issue #34: add invtype=sph in grott.ini [Generic] section (or use ginvtype=sph environmental variable e.g. for docker)
#### Growatt Smart Meter support
see issue #47: data will be processed automatically and send to MQTT, InfluxDB and PVOutput.org
#### Export to CSV file
see issue #79, pull request #91. Moe information can be found in the wiki: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki/Extensions 

### New in Version 2.5.x  
Improved dynamic data processing  and dynamic generation of output allowing: 
* add new output (values) without changing code (using external layout definitions)
* rename keywords in MQTT JSON message and influxDB to own naming convention 
* format the verbose output values
* Allow negative values for pvpowerout. New (always on) inverters can also use power. 
* Bugfix inluxdb port error

see: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki/Grott-advanced-(customize-behaviour)   
<br> 
Added new outout values to mqtt and influxDB to support 3 phase grid connection (actual information on voltage, current and power delivered), total active worktime (in 0.5 S) and energy generation per PV string (day and total)
<br>
     
Improve environmental processing for mqtt/influxDB/growatt ip and port definitions

### New in Version 2.4.0  
Introduce possibility to add extensions for additional (personalized) processing. 
,br.     
see: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki/Extensions

### New in Version 2.3.1  
Direct output to inlfuxdb (v1 and v2)   
<br> 
see: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki/InfluxDB-Support
### New in Version 2.2.6  
Mulitiple inverter (multiple system id's) support in PVOutput.org 
<br> 
see: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott/wiki/PVOutput.org-support 

#### Be aware: Wiith this release the default grott.ini moved to examples directory 
This file is deleted from the grott default directory to simply github installation (not overwrite your settings). 
It is advised to copy this file into the Grott default directory (and customise it) during first time installation 

### New in Version 2.2.1  
#### Automatic protocol detection and processing
Limited .ini configuration needed (inverterid, encryption, offset and record layout is automaticially detected)
#### Direct output to PVOutput.org (no mqtt processing needed). 
Specify pvoutput = True and apikey and systemid in .ini file to enable it. 
#### Docker support 
2 docker containers are created ledidobe/grottrpi (specific old RPI with ARM32) and ledidobe/grott (generic one, tested on synology NAS and Ubuntu). See https://hub.docker.com/search?q=ledidobe&type=image. 
See issue 4 and 15 on how to use it (wiki will be updated soon)
#### Command Blocking / Filtering
with blockcmd = True specified in .ini (configure/reboot) commands from outside to the inverter are blocked. This protects the inverter from beeing controlled from the outside while data exchange with server.growatt.com for reporting is still active.  
#### Use date/time from data record
If date/time is available in the data (inserted by the inverter) this will be used. In this way buffered records will be sent with the original  creation time (in the past). 
If date/time is not available in the data record the server time will be used (as it was originally). 
In the mqtt message the  key buffered is added (yes/no) which indicates that the message is from the buffer (past) or actual. 

### Version 2: Introduction of 2 modes support: sniff and proxy. 
In sniff mode (default and compatable with older Grott versions) IP sniffering technology is used (based on: https://github.com/buckyroberts/Python-Packet-Sniffer). In this mode the data needs to be "re-routed" using linux IP forwarding on the device Grott is running. In this mode Grott "sees" every IP package and when a Growatt TCP packages passes it will be processed and a MQTT will be sent if inverter status information is detected. 

With the proxy mode Grott is listening on a IP port (default 5279), processes the data (sent MQTT message) and routes the original packet to the growatt website. 

The proxy mode functionality can be enabled by: 

- mode = proxy in the conf.ini file 
- m proxy parameter during startup

Pro / Cons: 

    sniff mode
    + Data will also be routed to the growatt server if Grott is not active
    - All TCP packages (also not growatt) need to be processed by Grott. 
      This is more resource (processor) intesive and can have a negative impact on the device performance.
    - Configure IP forwarding can be complex if a lot of other network routing is configured (e.g. by Docker). 
    - Sudo rights necessary to allow network sniffering
    
    proxy mode: 
    + Simple configuration 
    + Only Growatt IP records are being analysed and processed by Grott 
    + Less resource intensive 
    + No sudo rights needed
    + Blocking / Filtering of commands from the outside is possible
    - If Grott is not running no data will be sent to the Growatt server

The adivse is to use the proxy mode. This mode is strategic and will be used for enhanced features like automatic protocol detection and command blocking filtering.  
<br>
Sniff mode is not supported under Windows
<br>
In sniff mode it is necessary to run Grott with SUDO rights. 

#### Minimal installation 
The following modules are needed the use Grott:
- grott.py
- grott.ini (available in examples direcory) 
- grottconf.py
- grottdata.py
- grottproxy.py
- grottsniffer.py

#### More Version History: see Version_history.txt file. 
#### Grott is a "hobby" project you can use it as it is (with the potential errors and imperfections). Remarks and requests for improvement are welcome.
