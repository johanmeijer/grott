#Grott Growatt monitor based on TCPIP sniffing or proxy (new 2.0) 
#             
#       Monitor needs to run on a (linux) system that is abble to see TCPIP that is sent from inverter to Growatt Server
#       
#       In the TCPIP sniffer mode this can be achieved by rerouting the growatt WIFI data via a Linux server with port forwarding
#
#       For more information how to see aditional documentation on github 
#
#       Monitor can run in forground and as a standard service!
#
#       For version history see: version_history.txt

# Updated: 2021-12-14'
